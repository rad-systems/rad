## About
As the name suggests, the RAD system is all about developing an application as quickly as possible to outpace your competitors.
### Security First
We take security very seriously and have designed the RAD system from the ground up with encryption at rest and in transit and even has the functionality for some data sets to be zero knowledge.
### Data Centric
Modern applications are all about the data. We provide the tools to manage all aspects of data including but not limited to:
* Distribution
* Encryption
* Merging
* Migration
* Mock Data
* Monetization
* Sharding
* Shared Schema (more on this below)
### Shared Schema
Defining a data base schema is a time consuming process and can be more like an art form. To save time and to get things right the first time the RAD system offers you to chare your schema publically (off by default) to aid in the future development process of others. Developers can then download a schema and pick with parts of the schema is relevant for their application.
### Naming conventions
The RAD system is strict about naming conventions, there is a right and wrong way to name a function, class, object, variable.
### Declarative
The applcation is built from the ground up to be declarative. This simplifies deployment, testing and code reuseability
TODO: Write developer guidlines
### Form Builder
Simple to use and feature rich form buildier
### Isomorphic
Rendered either on the server, client or a mix of the two.
### Front End Agnostic
The RAD system is not tied to any specific front and and can be used with REACT, Vue or customized template engines.
### Mobile Development
Develop for iOS and Android with the same code used for developing for web.
### Node Machines
We like the concept of node machines and use them extensively, they are self documenting, error preventing and universal.
### Hosting agnostic
Deploy locally or to the cloud, we integrate with all major hosting providers. Be multi cloud tenanted to get the most out of your hosting dollars.
### Simplified Testing
Writing unit and integration tests can be daunting. We combine unit testing and integration testing into the development process with the help of validation rules.
